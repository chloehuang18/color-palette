# Color Palette Project

I love colors! Colors make things beautiful and give you different feelings and messages. I have some knowledge of the color theory but I can't remember each color code. Whenever I did a web project, I always spent a good amount of time finding the right color, because I want to make sure my web pages look professional and neat. 
Finding the right colors for web pages plays a key role in the entire process.

Sometimes I think a color might look good for a background but when I actually use the color, it looks not as good as I thought. I want to build this project so that I can test different colors and get the color code I need.

# Background Tester
#### This feature will give you an accurate feeling of background color. 

# Color Picker
#### These are the colors I use often. This color palette can help me get the colors I like in a heartbeat!

# Color Comparison
#### This part will provide different color comparison charts that give me other ideas of the color choices and combinations.
